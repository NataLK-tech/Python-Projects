This project explores the sales performance of an online school. The data includes four files. 
The primary objective was to study and analyze unfamiliar data (automation was not part of the task).

Part 1: Data preparation - Loaded and reviewed the dataset structure. 
                           Identified data types, missing values, and noisy records.
                           Cleaned the data

Part 2: Data Analysis - Time series analysis
                        Campaign Effectiveness Analysis
                        Sales Department Performance Analysis
                        Analysis of Payments and Products


Notes:
- All unknown categorical values were retained for contextual analysis
- Time series were aligned by trimming early records to ensure compatibility
